The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"Politically Exposed Persons checks aim to ensure that businesses are not unwittingly associating with entities that could pose a risk to their reputation or may be involved in unethical practices.

Task Force (FATF) is an independent inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"Politically Exposed Persons checks aim to ensure that businesses are not unwittingly associating with entities that could pose a risk to their reputation or may be involved in unethical practices.

As such, conducting Politically Exposed Persons Checks is pivotal not only for adhering to compliance standards but also for ensuring the ethical and transparent operation of a business.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"Politically Exposed Persons checks aim to ensure that businesses are not unwittingly associating with entities that could pose a risk to their reputation or may be involved in unethical practices.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\\n\\nPolitically Exposed Persons checks aim to ensure that businesses are not unwittingly associating with entities that could pose a risk to their reputation or may be involved in unethical practices.

The minute the NYT report hit the stands on 17 May, Pakistani TV channels went into overdrive in an apparent bid to drag down Bol, a menacing looking potential rival that Axact bosses said would change Pakistan's media landscape. The momentum set by investigations into the fake degree scam finally caught up with Bol on Saturday when President and Editor-in-Chief of Axact's media group, Kamran Khan, tweeted he was quitting.\\n\\nSouthern District of New York | Pakistani Man Sentenced To 21 Months In Prison In Axact Diploma Mill Scam | United States Department of Justice Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that UMAIR HAMID was sentenced today to 21 months in prison for his role in an international diploma mill scheme operated through the Pakistani company Axact.
