As *WTR* has reported on, both Digitonics Labs and Abtach operated hundreds of websites offering such services (for example, in July, *WTR* investigated a $150,000 scam that began with a logo design, developed to web design, then led to extortionate fees related to patents and trademarks).\", \"The CBC Marketplace investigation also revealed several individuals who possess fake credentials from institutions tied to Axact including a counsellor named Gilbert Correces with a fake PhD in Biblical counselling from Almeda University, a professor named Dubravko Zgrablic who has taught at four post-secondary institutions in Ontario who claimed to have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Almeda University, a business consultant named Erwin Sniedzin who paid $8100 with no course work or exams to obtain a Master’s degree in Education from Kings Lake University, and a person named Inayat Kassam acting as a lawyer with a fake law degree from the University of Renfrew and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Axact-linked institution Ashwood University.\", \"Dec 13, 2016—authorities shut downAxactand arrested certain individuals believed to be involved in operating thisfraud,Axactcollected at least\", \"## Axact CEO, 22 others sentenced to 20 years in jail in fake degrees case A sessions court on Thursday convicted Axact chief executive officer Shoaib Sheikh and 22 others in the fake degrees scam case, awarding them a total of 20 years imprisonment each.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"* **Foreign PEPs:** individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example, heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials. In the European Union, the definition of PEPs was established many years ago with Directive 2005/60/EC to require institutions and persons covered to apply, on a risk-sensitive basis, enhanced customer due diligence measures surrounding transactions or business relationships with politically exposed persons residing in another member state or in a third country.\", \"Axact has left some traces of American connections as well.

According to the expert, the fraud activity most often being conducted by ex-Axact employees are related to fake degrees, logo design, ghostwriting, web design, and trademark filing. As *WTR* has reported on, both Digitonics Labs and Abtach operated hundreds of websites offering such services (for example, in July, *WTR* investigated a $150,000 scam that began with a logo design, developed to web design, then led to extortionate fees related to patents and trademarks).\", \"The CBC Marketplace investigation also revealed several individuals who possess fake credentials from institutions tied to Axact including a counsellor named Gilbert Correces with a fake PhD in Biblical counselling from Almeda University, a professor named Dubravko Zgrablic who has taught at four post-secondary institutions in Ontario who claimed to have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Almeda University, a business consultant named Erwin Sniedzin who paid $8100 with no course work or exams to obtain a Master’s degree in Education from Kings Lake University, and a person named Inayat Kassam acting as a lawyer with a fake law degree from the University of Renfrew and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Axact-linked institution Ashwood University.\", \"Dec 13, 2016—authorities shut downAxactand arrested certain individuals believed to be involved in operating thisfraud,Axactcollected at least\", \"## Axact CEO, 22 others sentenced to 20 years in jail in fake degrees case A sessions court on Thursday convicted Axact chief executive officer Shoaib Sheikh and 22 others in the fake degrees scam case, awarding them a total of 20 years imprisonment each.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"* **Foreign PEPs:** individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example, heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials.

According to the expert, the fraud activity most often being conducted by ex-Axact employees are related to fake degrees, logo design, ghostwriting, web design, and trademark filing. As *WTR* has reported on, both Digitonics Labs and Abtach operated hundreds of websites offering such services (for example, in July, *WTR* investigated a $150,000 scam that began with a logo design, developed to web design, then led to extortionate fees related to patents and trademarks).\", \"The CBC Marketplace investigation also revealed several individuals who possess fake credentials from institutions tied to Axact including a counsellor named Gilbert Correces with a fake PhD in Biblical counselling from Almeda University, a professor named Dubravko Zgrablic who has taught at four post-secondary institutions in Ontario who claimed to have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Almeda University, a business consultant named Erwin Sniedzin who paid $8100 with no course work or exams to obtain a Master’s degree in Education from Kings Lake University, and a person named Inayat Kassam acting as a lawyer with a fake law degree from the University of Renfrew and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Axact-linked institution Ashwood University.\", \"Dec 13, 2016—authorities shut downAxactand arrested certain individuals believed to be involved in operating thisfraud,Axactcollected at least\", \"## Axact CEO, 22 others sentenced to 20 years in jail in fake degrees case A sessions court on Thursday convicted Axact chief executive officer Shoaib Sheikh and 22 others in the fake degrees scam case, awarding them a total of 20 years imprisonment each.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"* **Foreign PEPs:** individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example, heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials.

Further research finds dozens of high-ranking employees at the IT companies Abtach and Digitonics Labs, both of which have been accused of operating fraudulent trademark agencies, previously worked for Axact. According to the expert, the fraud activity most often being conducted by ex-Axact employees are related to fake degrees, logo design, ghostwriting, web design, and trademark filing. As *WTR* has reported on, both Digitonics Labs and Abtach operated hundreds of websites offering such services (for example, in July, *WTR* investigated a $150,000 scam that began with a logo design, developed to web design, then led to extortionate fees related to patents and trademarks).\", \"The CBC Marketplace investigation also revealed several individuals who possess fake credentials from institutions tied to Axact including a counsellor named Gilbert Correces with a fake PhD in Biblical counselling from Almeda University, a professor named Dubravko Zgrablic who has taught at four post-secondary institutions in Ontario who claimed to have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Almeda University, a business consultant named Erwin Sniedzin who paid $8100 with no course work or exams to obtain a Master’s degree in Education from Kings Lake University, and a person named Inayat Kassam acting as a lawyer with a fake law degree from the University of Renfrew and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Axact-linked institution Ashwood University.\", \"Dec 13, 2016—authorities shut downAxactand arrested certain individuals believed to be involved in operating thisfraud,Axactcollected at least\", \"## Axact CEO, 22 others sentenced to 20 years in jail in fake degrees case A sessions court on Thursday convicted Axact chief executive officer Shoaib Sheikh and 22 others in the fake degrees scam case, awarding them a total of 20 years imprisonment each.

The FATF Recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. To address these risks, FATF Recommendations 12 and 22 require countries to ensure that financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) implement measures to prevent the misuse of the financial system and non-financial businesses and professions by PEPs, and to detect such potential abuse if and when it occurs. The FATF first issued mandatory requirements covering foreign PEPs, their family members and close associates1 in June 2003.2 In February 2012, the FATF expanded the mandatory requirements to domestic PEPs and PEPs of international organisations, in line with Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).3 Article 52 of the UNCAC defines PEPs as “individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates”, and includes both domestic and foreign PEPs.\", \"* **Foreign PEPs:** individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example, heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials. In the European Union, the definition of PEPs was established many years ago with Directive 2005/60/EC to require institutions and persons covered to apply, on a risk-sensitive basis, enhanced customer due diligence measures surrounding transactions or business relationships with politically exposed persons residing in another member state or in a third country.\", \"Axact has left some traces of American connections as well.
