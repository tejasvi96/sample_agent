    "name": "Axact (Axact Pvt. Ltd.)",
    "overall_risk_rating": "High",
    "is_red_flag": "Yes — major adverse-media, criminal convictions/pleas, and multi-jurisdictional enforcement actions make Axact a material red flag for onboarding or business relationships.",
    "summary": "Axact has been the subject of high-profile investigative reporting (New York Times), criminal investigations by Pakistan's FIA, a U.S. federal guilty plea and sentence for a senior executive (wire-fraud), and Pakistani court prosecutions. The combined weight of investigative journalism, U.S. DOJ action, and Pakistani prosecutions establishes significant reputational and legal risk."
