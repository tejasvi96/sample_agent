    "name": "Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ)",
    "overall_risk_rating": "High",

    "summary": "Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed is the President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi (since 2022), previously Crown Prince. He is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) with extensive public, political, and military roles. While no credible open sources show sanctions / criminal convictions against him at this time, the potential for foreign policy risk, adverse media, and influence on entities makes him a high-risk figure in KYC/AML assessments."
